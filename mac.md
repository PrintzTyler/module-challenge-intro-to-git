## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your 
source code histor.
2. Git is a version control system and GitHub is a hosting service that lets you 
manage Git repositories.
3. We make a branch to make and test changes that are not ready to be a part of 
the main branch.
4. A Pull request lets  you tell your team or team lead  about changes you've 
pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
5. In the video I watched in Module 1 "checkout" was used however acording to 
Google the command "switch" has replaced "checkout" in git although it can still 
be used.
6. Git Fetch is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes 
available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into it. Git Pull 
brings the changes into the local repository. Git merge merges your branch into 
the main branch.
7. Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a 
file by two diferent brances. You can also get a merge conflict if someone deletes 
a file in one branch that you edited in another.
8. To resolve a Merge conflict you need to decide if you want to keep only your 
branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new 
change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict 
markers and make the changes you want in the final merge. After that stage and 
commit. If the conflict is from a deleted file you need to add the file back to 
the branh where it is missing or delete it from the branch where it is not 
depending on if you want to keep it or not. After that you stage and commit.
